# Cancer_Medication_Challenge
The compay Pymaceuticals Inc. specialises in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
This code analyses the moost recent study data. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumours received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumour development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The data was cleaned so that any duplicates were removed before the analysis. Data collected includes:
- Mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumour volume for each drug tested 
- Number of mice tested for each drug 
- Sex distrubution of the mice
- The spread of the tumour sizes for each drug
- The tumour volumne over time for a mouce treated with the drug Capomulin
- The correlation betwwn the weight of the mice and the volume of the tumour
